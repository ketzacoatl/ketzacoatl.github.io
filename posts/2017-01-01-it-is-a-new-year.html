<p>Wow, 2016 seems like one of those years we will speak about for a while.</p>
<p>A leap year, some circles recognized it as the <em>Quantum Leap Year</em>.</p>
<p>With 2017 now upon us, and while in the depths of winter, I look forward to cultivating the creative inner spirit we need to figure ourselves out and come out on top. Precariously perched on the edge of global disaster, it does not need to be like this, and we can choose to turn it all around if we choose our creations wisely.</p>
<p>In the year ahead, I will continue to contribute to the world I wish to create. I will value and help cultivate organizations and communities that embrace transparency, integrity, diversity, responsibility, accountability, horizontal governance, faith, and hard work.</p>
<p>We need to care about the affect our contributions have on the world around us, and we need to believe a better, more just, sane, enjoyable and productive world really is possible. If we care about making that happen, we will have all the opportunity to do so.</p>
<p>“<em>I’ve got my doubts, but there’s no time for that now</em>”</p>
<p>Are you ready to get into it with me?</p>
